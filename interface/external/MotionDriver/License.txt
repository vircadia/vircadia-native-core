of the remainder of this Agreement shall not be affected if the illegal or
unenforceable provision does not materially affect the intent of this
Agreement.  If the illegal or unenforceable provision materially affects the
intent of the parties to this Agreement, this Agreement shall become

to seek and obtain immediate injunctive relief to enforce obligations under
the Agreement in addition to any other rights and remedies it may have.

and representations between them, whether written or oral concerning the
Software.  This Agreement may be changed only by mutual agreement of the
